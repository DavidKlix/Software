    "Many times you are working on your program (perhaps something with long runtimes or multiple steps), and you want to stop in the middle for some reason.  Maybe you haven't completed a further part, or need to step away from the computer.  Often it can be helpful to preserve your program state for later. The `pickle` module can help you do this.  Pickling your data dumps a raw Python data structure to a binary(ish) format that can be easy to read in at a later date.  \n",

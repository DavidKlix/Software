    "# Debugging in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes (and this may come as a shock) code we write just doesn't work correctly.  Python, as an interpreted language, has no compile-time check to see if you used the language correctly (for example, adding a number to a string), and as a weakly typed language can cause issues since **both** the type and the value of a variable can be unknown at any point in time. In situations like this it can be helpful to inspect the state of the program (including variable contents). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past you may have done this using print statements scattered throughout your source code to see what was happening.  However, there are more sophisticated tools that allow us as programmers to get a much better idea as to what is happening when our program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for simple things running in either the editor or the IPython console, you can use the Variable explorer (by default) found in the upper right pane of Spyder to see the contents of your variabes.  Additionally the Variable explorer will do some other interesting things (like color code your 2D arrays) that can make it easier to explore your current IDE state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A debugger is a tool that runs your code (usually slower), but allows you to pause and control execution, view variable state, and execute arbitrary commands given the current paused state at any time.  By using these we can hunt down problems in our code much easier than if we were to sprinkle print statements throughout."

    "## Walk through on using Debugger in Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to realize is that the debugger is _only_ available when running code in the Editor tab of Spyder.  This is a tool you will use to investigate issues in more complicated programs and modules that you write instead of code snippets run in the Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is familiarize yourself with the debugging toolbar:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Debug Toolbar](imgs/dbug_toolbar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From left to right, these buttons are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debug file (Debug)\n",
    "* Run current line (Step Over)\n",
    "* Step into function or method of current line (Step Into)\n",
    "* Run until current function or method returns (Step Out Of)\n",
    "* Continue execution unil next breakpont (Continue)\n",
    "* Stop debugging (Stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "The tooltips contain keyboard shortcuts if you are so inclined to use them.  Next to the button names I have put common short names for these operations in parenthesis (which is how they will be referred to throughout this tutoral).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The following source code is used in the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def foo():\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    y = 10\n",
    "    return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "def bar(a):\n",
    "    return a - foo();\n",
    "\n",
    "my_var = 10\n",
    "result = bar(my_var)\n",
    "for i in range(my_var):\n",
    "    result = bar(result)\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting the debugger is simple; have the file (starting point) you want to debug in your Editor window, and start the debugger with the Debug button.  \n",
    "![Started Debugger](imgs/dbug_start.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line of the multiline comment is highlighted red, and the IPython console has changed to have the prompt `ipdb>`.  It is now waiting for input.  You can control the debugger by using the toolbar or by inputting text commands into the IPython console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try hitting the Step Over button (Execute current line). You will notice that the `def foo():` line is now highlighted.  Stepping over again will skip over `foo()` to `def bar(a):`.  Step over once more.  The line `my_var = 10` should now be highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the variable does not appear in the Variable explorer yet; this is because the debugger shows us what line is _about_ to be executed, not what has been executed.  If we Step Over again, you will see that `my_var` has been added to the Variable explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Executing variable assignment](imgs/dbug_var_explorer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitting Step Over again moves the program past line 16 to the `for` loop even though there was a function call.  This is because the Step Over functionality will run the line and execute any functions without stopping.  If we want to investigate inside a function we will need to use the power to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Into\n",
    "\n",
    "Hit Step Over until the line `result = bar(result)` is highlighted. Then hit the Step Into button.  You should see that `def bar(a):` is now highlighted:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stepped Into](imgs/dbug_step_into.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can Step Over (if we want to skip the call to `foo()` or Step Into `foo()` if we so desire!  This allows us to have more granular control of the execution of our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to get out of the function we are in, we can use the Step Out Of button to continue running code until we complete the current function or method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continue\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can walk through our program quite simply using Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out Of.  However, the line `result = bar(result)` is in a loop, and this may take quite some time to run.  Hitting the Continue button will run the code until the very end, which doesn't seem that useful, right? Try it! \n",
    "\n",
    "For Continue to be useful, we need to combine it with a concept called _Breakpoints_.  A breakpoint is a line in code that we have indicated the debugger should stop at.  The Continue button will execute code until it reaches the Breakpoint, and from there we can use the more granular controls to hunt down the problems with our code.  Let's try placing a breakpoint in `foo()` by double clicking next to the line number on the left hand side (we sometimes call this the gutter).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Breakpoints](imgs/dbug_breakpoint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove a breakpoint by double clicking it in the gutter.  You can also have multiple breakpoints in your source code.  Restart the debugger (either with Stop then start, or continue until it is done, or typing `restart` in the IPython console), then hit Continue.  The program will run until it reaches the line we put the breakpoint at (in my case, `y = 10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incredibly useful when the part of our code we want to investigate is deep in our code, or later on in program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CoolThing(tm) in the `ipdb` debugger is the ability to set conditional breakpoints; you may want to investigate that in the Debug menu in Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing arbitrary statements\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time you can run arbitrary python statements in the IPython console (with the `ipdb>` prompt) that will run using the current state of variables.  This can be useful if you want to know how some calculation will end up, or want to see the result of a more complicated expression.  Play around!"

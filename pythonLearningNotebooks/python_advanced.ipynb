    "Python is an interpreted language, which means that every time you run a Python program the interpreter reads the next command in the file and evaluates it.  This is a slow operation (re-interpreting lines that have been read once is extra time), and is one disadvantage Python has over compiled languages (like the C's).\n",

    "**However** the reference implementation of Python (also called CPython) is implemented in C, which means that any time you call a built in Python function, your code will run at the speed of C (both C as the programming language, and c as the constant that stands for the speed of light in E=mc^2). As such, the fewer lines(or statements) of code you can write in Python, the faster your code will run.  Consider a situation where you want to create a list that contains the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.  The slowest (and arguably most readable) way to do this would be:"
